# Cutting a paper to length

_This is very much in progress, growing as I cut papers down and recording the strategies I employ in the process. 
It is mainly intended as a reference for students I am working with and may have tips that are domain/style/tool specific-ish_

Typically this can be done mostly with sentence-level fixes over content cutting.

## Just remove

- cut "in particular", "however", "additionally" type intros. they don't add clarity but do take up space
- check for "of" that can be removed eg "representation of a group" to "group representation"
- don't use a heading for small sections, eg no heading unless 3+ sentences

## Replacements
- change phrases like "not only ... but also" to " ... and"
- use active verbs are almost always fewer words
-  "as shown by author" or "author showed" etc credit other's work with a crisp sentence that summarizes their work and an intext citation instead of
- change phrases of the "are verbing" to verb where possible

## Deeper revisions
- sentences with also that reference to previous parts of a paragraph can be sometimes combined
- if you're using a wordy phrase repeatedly consider introducing a new term that captures the whole thing  

## LaTeX specific tips and strategies
- use inline numbered lists (see enumitem package);
- a trick I use in big rephrases is to copy the sentence, comment out one copy as is and then try to change it to be shorter,
